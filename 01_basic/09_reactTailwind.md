# 🟢 1️⃣ Tailwind in React

### What is Tailwind?

> Tailwind is a CSS framework that lets you style using small utility classes.

Instead of writing CSS like:

```css
.button {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

In React with Tailwind, you write:

```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">
  Click
</button>
```

### 🧠 Important in React

In React we use:

```
className
```

NOT

```
class
```

Because `class` is reserved in JavaScript.

### Why use Tailwind?

* Fast styling
* No separate CSS file needed
* Clean component-based styling
* Very popular in modern React projects
