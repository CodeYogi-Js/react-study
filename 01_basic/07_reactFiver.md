> **React Fiber is the internal rendering engine introduced in React 16 that makes React faster by breaking UI updates into small units and prioritizing important tasks.**

If they want even shorter:

> **React Fiber is React’s rendering engine that improves performance and enables smoother updates.**


# 🟢 What is React Fiber?

👉 **React Fiber is the new engine of React.**

That’s it.

---

# 🧠 Simple Meaning

Before React 16, React had an old engine.
After React 16, React started using **Fiber**.

So:

> React Fiber = the system that controls how React updates the screen.

# 🎬 Real Life Example

Think like this:

* React = car 🚗
* Fiber = engine inside the car

You don’t see the engine.
But it controls how the car runs.

# 🟢 What Problem Did Fiber Solve?

Old React had a problem:

When updating UI:

* It updated everything at once
* Large apps could freeze for a moment

Fiber made React:

* Faster
* Smoother
* Able to pause work
* Able to prioritize important updates

---

# 🧠 Super Simple Explanation

Imagine you are doing homework and someone asks you a question.

Old React:

* Finish all homework first
* Then answer

React Fiber:

* Pause homework
* Answer question
* Continue homework

That’s smarter.

# 🔥 What Fiber Actually Does

Fiber helps React:

1. Break work into small pieces
2. Pause work if needed
3. Continue later
4. Decide what is important

This is why React can now:

* Use Concurrent features
* Use Suspense
* Use transitions
