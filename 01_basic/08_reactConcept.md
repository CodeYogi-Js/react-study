# ✅ 1️⃣ React Components, Elements, and Instances

### 🔹 React Component

> A component is a reusable function or class that returns UI.

Example:

```jsx
function Button() {
  return <button>Click</button>;
}
```

Simple memory:
👉 Component = UI blueprint

---

### 🔹 React Element

> A React element is a plain JavaScript object that describes what should appear on the screen.

Example:

```jsx
<Button />
```

Simple memory:
👉 Element = description of UI

---

### 🔹 React Instance

> An instance is the actual running version of a component when it is rendered in the DOM.

Simple memory:
👉 Instance = real component in browser

---

# ✅ 2️⃣ Reconciliation

> Reconciliation is the process where React compares the old virtual DOM with the new virtual DOM and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM.

Simple memory:
👉 Reconciliation = compare and update

# ✅ 3️⃣ React Basic Theoretical Concepts

You should know:

* Component-based architecture
* Virtual DOM
* Unidirectional data flow
* State & Props
* JSX

Short explanation:

👉 React builds UI using components.
👉 It uses Virtual DOM for fast updates.
👉 Data flows from parent to child.

# ✅ 4️⃣ React Design Principles

React is built on these ideas:

### 🔹 Declarative

You describe what UI should look like.

### 🔹 Component-Based

UI is divided into small reusable components.

### 🔹 Learn Once, Write Anywhere

React works for web, mobile (React Native), etc.

### 🔹 Single Direction Data Flow

Data flows from parent → child.

# 🎯 Ultra Short Interview Version

If interviewer asks quickly:

**Components** → Reusable UI blocks
**Elements** → UI description objects
**Reconciliation** → Virtual DOM comparison process
**Design Principle** → Declarative, component-based, one-way data flow
